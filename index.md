<strong> Tree harvesting quality measurement device </strong>
<strong> Technical skills: Embedded software, ESP32, Machine Learning </strong>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> This device detect and log the harvesting process quality (height, speed, others) using machine learning to adapt itself for different operators and environments. Duo the extremely harsh enviroment a creative array of indirect sensors were used.</div>
