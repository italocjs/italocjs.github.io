<strong> Tree harvesting quality measurement device </strong>
<strong> Technical skills: Embedded software, ESP32, Machine Learning </strong>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> This device detect and log the harvesting process quality (height, speed, others) using machine learning to adapt itself for different operators and environments. Duo the extremely harsh enviroment a creative array of indirect sensors were used.

<strong> CNC Router.</strong>
<strong> Technical skills: 3D Modelling, Electrical Engineering, C Programming, Automation </strong>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> I have built a medium sized (1000x1000x300mm useful area) CNC for myself, as compact as possible, the main goal is to machine aeronautical grade aluminum (7075) with a 4kW spindle, high precision 30KGF servo's, 20mm leadscrew and 20mm linear rails were used on all axis to improve tolerance.  The controller is an original Mach3 USB Controller.</div>

<strong> 3D Printer development, Model "Office".</strong>
<strong> Technical skills: 3D Modelling, C++ Programming, Hardware development </strong>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">A compact 3D Printer developed for the industrial market (processing materials such as nylon, tritan and petg).

I Have been involved with:
- Hardware programming (Raspbery PI3, ATMEGA2560)
- PCB development
- 3D Modelling and simulations
- Development of the manufacturing process, including validating suppliers and lean manufacturing
This machine has been developed and constantly updated for 3DTecnologia LTDA over ~2 years, while i worked there.</div>
